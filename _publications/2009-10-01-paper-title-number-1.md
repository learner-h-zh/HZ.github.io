title: "Rotation-Invariant Feature Enhancement with Dual-Aspect Loss for Arbitrary-Oriented Object Detection in Remote Sensing"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2025-05-07-paper-Applied Sciences-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper proposes RFE-FCOS, which focuses on improving object detection in remote sensing imagery by incorporating multi-angle rotation-invariant learning. The method significantly enhances detection performance, particularly for arbitrarily oriented objects, achieving robust results on the DIOR-R and HRSC2016 benchmarks.'
